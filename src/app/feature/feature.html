            Mang Inasal began its flavorful journey in 2003 in Iloilo City,
            founded by the visionary Edgar "Injap" Sia II. What started as a
            humble grilled chicken stall quickly captured the hearts — and
            appetites — of Filipinos with its signature smoky flavor and
            unlimited rice offering. In just a few years, Mang Inasal grew from
            a single store into a nationwide sensation, opening over 500
            branches across the Philippines.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            In 2016, Mang Inasal joined the Jollibee Foods Corporation family,
            further strengthening its reach and impact. Today, it stands not
            just as a beloved dining destination, but as a symbol of Filipino
            entrepreneurial spirit. With every grilled chicken served, Mang
            Inasal continues to redefine local dining and inspire a new
            generation of homegrown success stories.
